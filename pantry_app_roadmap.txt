Seed initial ingredients + recipes for testing

Deliverable:

ingredients table has test data

recipes and recipe_ingredients tables ready

Week 4: Flask Pantry Page (Read)

Goals:

Display ingredients from MySQL in Flask

Basic HTML list

Week 7: Recipe Pages (Create & Update)

Goals:

Add new recipes

Add ingredients to recipes (junction table)

Optional: Edit existing recipes

Week 10: Shopping List Editing & Misc Items

Goals:

Allow user to:

Add miscellaneous items

Remove items from shopping list

Recalculate total cost dynamically

Deliverable:
Editable shopping list page in Flask.

Week 11: Final Touches & Recipe Quick Reference

Goals:

Add a quick recipe reference page:

Select recipe → display instructions

CSS styling for readability on phone

Optional: search/filter ingredients or recipes

Deliverable:

Fully functional app for pantry, recipes, shopping list

Looks clean on mobile

Week 12: Deployment & GitHub Pages

Goals:

Export final shopping list to a static HTML page

Commit full project to GitHub

Optional: host static pages on GitHub Pages for mobile access

Polish styling, fix bugs, test all features

Deliverable:

Fully deployed project

GitHub repo submission ready

Tips for Success

Use JOINs for recipe + ingredient relationships

Keep database helper (database.py) for all queries

Build feature by feature — don’t try to do everything at once

Test in small pieces: insert → read → display → edit → delete

CSS last, focus on functionality first
